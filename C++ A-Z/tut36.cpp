// ## Inheritance and its different types

/* 1. Single inheritance
A --> B // --> A derives B
A <-- B // <-- B is Derived from A 
B = A + More
// Here A is base class and B is derived class

2. Multiple inheritance:
Employee(A), Assistant(B) --> Programmer(C) (Some of A and Some of B)
Programmer = Employee + Assistant + More

3. Hierarchical inheritance:
Employee(C) --> Programmer(A) + Manager (B)
Programmer = Employee + More
Manager = Employee + More

4. Multilevel inheritance:
Animal(A) --> Mammal(B) --> Cow(C) (Inheritance Path)
Mammal = Animal + More
Cow = Mammal + More

5. Hybrid inheritance: // Combination of Multiple and Multilevel inheritance. Also combination of Multiple and Hierarchical inheritance
Animal(A) --> Mammal(B) + Bird(C) --> Bat(D)
