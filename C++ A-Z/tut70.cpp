// ## Containers in C++ STL

/*
Containers-
    1. Sequence Containers - Linear Fashion
        1.1 Vector
        1.2 List
        1.3 Dequeue
    2. Associative Containers - Direct Access
        2.1 Set/Multiset
        2.2 Map/Multimap
    3. Derived Containers - Real world modeling
        3.1 Stack (LIFO- Last in First out)
        3.2 Queue (FIFO- First in First out)
        3.3 Priority queue

When to use?
1. Sequence Containers-
                                    Vector  List
Random Access(RA)                   Fast    Slow
Middle Insertion/Deletion           Slow    Fast
Insertion/Deletion at the end       Fast    Fast

2. Associative Containers-
                                    All
Random Access(RA)                   Slow
Middle Insertion/Deletion           Fast
Insertion/Deletion at the end       Fast

3. Derived Containers-
                                    All
Random Access(RA)                   Depends
Middle Insertion/Deletion           Depends
Insertion/Deletion at the end       Depends
